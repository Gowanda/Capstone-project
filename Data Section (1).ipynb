This can be used to draw a map of the possible spots(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_Montreal).\n\nWe will use BeautifulSoup library to extract data from Wikipidea page.\n\nWe will use Google Geocode API to identify the Borough centers.\n\nWe will draw on the Folium map, potential spot (in a hexagone shape) around Borough spots.\n\nAfter creating the list of new candidates positions on the map, we are interested in filtering this spots using the information provided by Foursquare API (https://foursquare.com/) Foursquare is a local search-and-discovery mobile app/website that provides valuable information of places to go near a user's specific location. We will be exploring the Foursquare API by providing geografic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of our candiadates positions, in order to get in return the nearby \"venues\". We will use the number of nearby venues and their categories as a filter to narrow down our potential locations\n\nNow the list of candidates location is shorter, we can use Google reverse Geocode (by giving latitude and longitude of a location and getting an address in return) in order to identify the address of these spots on the maps, which is useful in order to visit them in the future.\n\nSince the number of these addresses remains high and the locations are scattered around the city, it is very hard to compare between them, so we will use Clusterifcation method (machine learning) and deep analysis in order to get more insights by comparing clusters and selecting the ones that fits our criterias\n\nWe will focus our analysis for the next section on 4 main aspects for the comnparaison:\n\n\u2022 Number of Restaurants per Cluster\n\n\u2022 Ratio of Restaurants per 1 million capita\n\n\u2022 Number of Italian Restaurant per Cluster\n\n\u2022 Number of Parks per Cluster"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
